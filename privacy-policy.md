# Privacy Policy for Discord Web Quest Completer

**Last Updated:** 12/7/2025

## Introduction

Discord Web Quest Completer ("the Extension") is a browser extension that provides helper functionality for Discord quest features. This privacy policy explains how the Extension handles user data and information.

## Data Collection

**The Extension does not collect, store, or transmit any user data.**

The Extension operates entirely locally within your browser and does not:

- Collect personally identifiable information (name, address, email, age, identification numbers)
- Collect health information
- Collect financial or payment information
- Collect authentication information (passwords, credentials, PINs)
- Collect personal communications (emails, texts, chat messages)
- Collect location data (region, IP address, GPS coordinates)
- Collect web history or browsing data
- Collect user activity data (clicks, mouse position, scroll, keystrokes)
- Collect website content (text, images, sounds, videos, hyperlinks)
- Transmit any data to external servers or third parties
- Use analytics or tracking services
- Store data in local storage, session storage, or browser storage APIs

## How the Extension Works

The Extension:

- Only operates on `https://discord.com/*` pages
- Modifies HTTP request headers (User-Agent) for Discord.com requests to enhance quest functionality
- Injects helper scripts into Discord pages when users interact with the extension
- Interacts with Discord's own API endpoints for quest-related features
- Uses console logging for debugging purposes only (logs remain local to your browser)

All functionality is performed locally within your browser. The Extension does not communicate with any external servers except for normal interactions with Discord's own services that occur as part of standard Discord web usage.

## Permissions

The Extension requires the following permissions:

- **Host Permission (`https://discord.com/*`)**: Required to provide functionality on Discord's website
- **Scripting Permission**: Required to inject helper scripts into Discord pages
- **ActiveTab Permission**: Required to access the active Discord tab when users interact with the extension
- **DeclarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess**: Required to modify request headers for Discord.com requests

These permissions are used solely for the Extension's core functionality and are not used to collect or transmit user data.

## Third-Party Services

The Extension does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or data collection services.

## Data Sharing

The Extension does not share any data with third parties because it does not collect any data.

## User Rights

Since the Extension does not collect any user data, there is no user data to access, modify, or delete. Users can uninstall the Extension at any time through their browser's extension management interface.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the Extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
